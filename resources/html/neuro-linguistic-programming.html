          <h3>About NLP</h3>
          <p>Neuro Linguistic Programming (or NLP) is a revolutionary field of study that explains how the mind works and how one can change one?s thoughts and belief systems, and achieve one?s full potential. NLP explores the relationship between
            how we think (Neuro), how we communicate with each other and to ourselves (Linguistic), and how we program our thought patterns and behavior (Programming). It is an extremely powerful communication tool that can help monitor our thinking
            and adapt our behaviour in order to achieve excellent results. By changing one?s outlook, a person can change his / her attitude and actions, hence the results.
          </p>
          <p>NLP is also defined as the Art and Science of Excellence, modeled on how top people in different fields obtain their outstanding results. It involves the use of guided visualizations along with specific language patterns to initiate
