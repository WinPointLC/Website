                <p>The explanation of every topic in Core Java 8 was clearly understood. What I like the most
                  is, the focus is more on Practical than Theory. I was scared about coding and programming before joining the course, but that fear
                  has gone. Anjali Ma'am took lot of efforts on us.

                  In data structure, Anjali Ma'am gave us hints and not the whole solution which helped me in
                  logic development. I really appreciate the efforts taken by Ma'am to make me understand the concepts.

                </p>
                <p>Just an excellent technical sessions conducted by Anjali Mam have provided a lot of practical knowledge. She has changed my approach towards Coding and Problem Solving. Database sessions were simply amazing.The Verbal Skills
                  module also helped me to boost my communication skills and raise the level of my confidence. Overall the CRT Niche + TBC Program was really helpful. The concepts were cleared practically. Especially talking about C, C++, and Data
                  Structures, we did a lot of coding practice here. Also the quality of MCQs was very nice. It was observed that the level of actual MCQs asked by companies was below that of WinPoint questions. If students study the WinPoint
                  courseware only, it would be more than sufficient.

                <p>TBC program was very good & it provided us with an opportunity to learn C, C++, Databases, & Data Structures right from the conceptual level. We got a lot of practical knowledge during TBC & also a chance to develop our logical
                  thinking. In the CRT (Niche) Program, QA topics were nicely taught, & enough practice was given on each one of them. Verbal Skills sessions were very good & they helped develop grammar concepts & communication skills.

                <p>Strenghts of the TBC + CRT (Niche) Program:
                  Deep/thorough understanding of the concept
                  Lot of emphasis on the practical
                  sessions/implementations
                  Improvement in good coding practices
                  Discussion about industrial approaches
                  Comparative study among various different topics
                  Lot of similarity in the technical assessment of the niche
                  companies and that of WinPoint
                  Enables candidates to develop thinking to solve the
                  problems conceptually
                  WinPoint?s evaluation is more difficult than that of most
                  of the companies so it helps a lot.

                <p>The CRT Niche program was conducted with proper planning. The faculty members were well prepared, had good expertise in their respective fields and used practical examples to make the participants understand the concept. The efforts put by all faculty members were very helpful in preparing us for the interview process. Tests were conducted at regular intervals to analyze our progress in the subjects taught. Everyone who taught us, Makarand Sir, Anjali Mam, Sandeep Sir, and Mandar Sir were extremely supportive to the students.

                <p>CRT gives a better exposure to us as we don?t have a substantial medium to gain knowledge about the corporate world.

Wave II was very useful for technical and behavioral skills development. Flexible approach and scheduling the sessions based on mutual convenience are highly appreciable. One to one communication between the trainer and the student is the biggest strength of this program.
