						<h3>About WinPoint</h3>
						<p>
							WinPoint is focused on providing solution and services in the areas of Learning, Consultancy, and Projects. The Learning practice at WinPoint is engaged with Corporate, Academic Institute, and Individual (Experienced Professional, Fresher,
							and Student) for developing Career Competency in the areas of Software Skills, Behavioral Skills (including NLP), Executive Coaching, and Function & Role based Hard Skills. Based on our past experience in the areas of Consultancy,
							Transformation, & Center of Excellence (CoE) development, WinPoint is well-positioned to partner with Corporate & Academic Institutes for designing & implementing key strategic & operational initiatives for efficiency improvement and cost
							reduction. We have project execution capabilities around JAVA/J2EE platform and we are looking to leverage the same for delivering web and mobile application development projects.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to NASSCOM, over 75% Engineering graduates and about 80% MBA graduates in India are not fit for the industry. Based on our 'Root Cause Analysis' for this systemic failure, we believe that 'Raising the Bar' is an evolutionary
							mechanism and not an overnight gimmick. To ensure long-term and sustainable success, the focus of the trainees should be on 'Competency Development' and 'Pursuit of Knowledge' instead of quick fixes for employment/placement/jobs. The key is
							to plan ahead of time & make an early start on the skill development road-map so as to provide oneself with plenty of time to institutionalize the required proficiency.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are committed to serve the industry by developing skilled people, keeping in mind the specific competencies required to perform ?Day-in-Life? activities for different roles. Through our consultative approach, we help the candidates develop
							a ?Career/Competency Development Plan? to meet their aspirations in alignment to corporate expectations. We shape up career of the potential aspirants by helping them raise their profile leading to a winning position for fast-tracking their
							growth.
